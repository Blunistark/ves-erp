## 🚀 How to Use the Workflow

### Daily Development
```powershell
# Create a new feature
.\git-workflow.ps1 feature user-dashboard-improvements

# Work on your feature, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add: improved user dashboard layout"

# Merge feature to dev when complete
.\git-workflow.ps1 merge-feature

# Release to production when ready
.\git-workflow.ps1 release
```

### Using Git Aliases
```bash
git new-feature student-portal-enhancements
git st                    # Check status
git add-all              # Add all files
git cm "Add: new feature" # Commit
git merge-to-dev         # Merge to dev
git release              # Release to main
```

### Branch Management
```bash
git lg                   # Pretty log with graph
git branches             # List all branches
git cleanup-merged       # Remove merged feature branches
```

## 🛠️ Available Tools

### PowerShell Scripts
```powershell
.\git-workflow.ps1 feature <name>    # Create feature branch
.\git-workflow.ps1 merge-feature     # Merge to dev
.\git-workflow.ps1 release           # Release to main
.\git-workflow.ps1 status            # Show status
.\setup-git-aliases.ps1              # Install aliases
.\setup-git-hooks.ps1 -Install       # Install hooks
```

### Git Aliases (Already Installed)
- `git new-feature <name>` - Create feature branch
- `git merge-to-dev` - Merge current branch to dev
- `git release` - Merge dev to main
- `git lg` - Pretty log with graph
- `git cleanup-merged` - Delete merged branches

## 🔒 Quality Assurance

### Commit Message Format (Enforced)
```
Type: Brief description (minimum 10 characters)

Valid types: Add, Update, Fix, Remove, Refactor, Style, Docs, Test, Chore
```

### Pre-commit Checks (Active)
- PHP syntax validation
- Debug code detection (var_dump, console.log, etc.)
- Sensitive data warning (passwords, API keys)

### Line Ending Handling
- PHP/HTML/CSS/JS files: LF endings
- PowerShell scripts: CRLF endings  
- Binary files: No conversion

## 📝 Next Steps

### For Development Team
1. **Clone and setup**: All developers should run `.\setup-git-aliases.ps1`
2. **Install hooks**: Run `.\setup-git-hooks.ps1 -Install` in each local repo
3. **Read documentation**: Review `GIT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`
4. **Practice workflow**: Create test features to learn the system

### For Project Management
1. **Branch policies**: Consider implementing branch protection rules if using GitHub/GitLab
2. **CI/CD integration**: Workflow is ready for automated testing and deployment
3. **Code reviews**: Establish pull request processes for feature merges
4. **Release planning**: Use semantic versioning with git tags

## 🎯 Workflow Benefits

### ✅ Achieved
- **Consistency**: Standardized development process
- **Quality**: Automated validation and checks
- **Productivity**: Streamlined commands and aliases
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and references
- **Collaboration**: Clear branching strategy for teams
- **Traceability**: Structured commit history and tagging

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Remote repository integration (GitHub/GitLab)
- Automated testing pipeline integration
- Advanced pre-commit hooks (code style, security scanning)
- Release automation with changelog generation

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Always work on feature branches** - Never commit directly to main or dev
2. **Use descriptive branch names** - `feature/student-attendance-module`
3. **Write clear commit messages** - Follow the enforced format
4. **Test before merging** - Ensure features work in dev before release
5. **Keep branches small** - Smaller features are easier to review and merge
6. **Regular cleanup** - Use `git cleanup-merged` to remove old branches
