- Remaining "term" references are only UI text (e.g., "Mid-Term Exams") which are appropriate to keep
- No functional venue or term database field references remain in the codebase

## IMPACT
- Simplified exam management system by removing complexity of term and venue tracking
- Streamlined user interfaces across admin and student dashboards
- Reduced database storage requirements
- Maintained all core exam functionality while removing unnecessary fields

## STATUS: âœ… COMPLETE
